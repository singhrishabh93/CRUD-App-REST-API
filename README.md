This is a RESTful API for a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose.

## Features

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing resources
- RESTful API endpoints for interacting with the resources
- MongoDB for data storage
- Mongoose for modeling and interacting with MongoDB
- Error handling and validation
- Authentication and authorization (optional)

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/singhrishabh93/CRUD-App-REST-API.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up the MongoDB connection in the configuration file: `config/database.js`
4. Start the server: `npm start`
5. The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`

## API Endpoints

The following endpoints are available for interacting with the resources:

- `GET /resources` - Get all resources
- `POST /resources` - Create a new resource
- `GET /resources/:id` - Get a specific resource by ID
- `PUT /resources/:id` - Update a specific resource by ID
- `DELETE /resources/:id` - Delete a specific resource by ID

## Authentication and Authorization

If you want to add authentication and authorization to your API, you can use strategies like JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or session-based authentication. You can implement authentication middleware to protect specific routes or resources based on user roles and permissions.

## Error Handling

The API handles common errors and provides appropriate responses. Error handling middleware can be found in the `middlewares/error.js` file.
